                <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa 
                (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
                </p>

                <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends 
                up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands
                it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

                </a>
                <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), 
                get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room 
                with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
                </p>

                <p>He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and 
                dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, 
                he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

                <p>Happy is an old cat. He spends a lot of his day lounging around, in whatever spot he feels is most comfortable at the time. 
                He is an indoor cat, but whenever we open the door to let the dogs out, he always comes running out so he can eat grass.
                </p>

                <p>Happy is pretty friendly with one of my dogs, Katie. They do not interact much, but when they do, it is usually just friendly sniffs. 
                My other dog, Izzy, however, loves biting at Happy. 
                Happy usually will just run away, but sometimes he will retaliate by giving Izzy a smack! It is all in good fun though.

                <p>Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. 
                He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.
                </p>

                <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from him and he 
                will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker 
                with the poodle when it was being loud.

                <p>Subin was somehow not bothered by vaccum cleaners. Even though the loudness of it was able to scare any

He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
                
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>
